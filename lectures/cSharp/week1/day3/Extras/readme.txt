Three Basic Arrays
Create an integer array with the values 0 through 9 inside.
Create a string array with the names "Tim", "Martin", "Nikki", and "Sara".
Create a boolean array of length 10. Then fill it with alternating true/false values, starting with true. (Tip: do this using logic! Do not hard-code the values in!)


List of Flavors
Create a string List of ice cream flavors that holds at least 5 different flavors. (Feel free to add more than 5!)
Output the length of the List after you added the flavors.
Output the third flavor in the List.
Now remove the third flavor using its index location.
Output the length of the List again. It should now be one fewer.


User Dictionary
Create a dictionary that will store string keys and string values.
Add key/value pairs to the dictionary where:
Each key is a name from your names array (this can be done by hand or using logic)
Each value is a randomly selected flavor from your flavors List (remember Random from earlier?)
Loop through the dictionary and print out each user's name and their associated ice cream flavor.
