Create a class called squishi to create a squishi instance we have to give it a name and by default it will have a stuffing value of true 

class Squishi {
    // These are the attributes that every squishi we ever make will HAVE to have

    public string Name;
    public bool Stuffing;

    // Constructor tells us the attributes we get to make up vs are already determined for us
    // in this constructor we know that we get to make up a name for our squishi but we are already told that it will have stuffing
    // inside the () is what we can make up 
    // if it is already told to us it will have it's value in the {} when it is called there
    // Everything that each squishi HAS to HAVE will have an entry in the {}

    public Squishi(string theName) {
        Name = theName;
        Stuffing = true;
    }

    // After the constructor comes our methods..... what can we make our squishies do or what can we do with them or something regarding them

    // we can print their info (do with them)
    public void PrintInfo() {
        ........
    }

    // we can make them hug each other (what we can make our squishies do)
    public void Hug() {
        ........
    }
}

Create a desk class where our squishies can go to live the desk has a name and a default hight and a list that will contain the squishies living there 
we create an empty list because person 1 has a desk and squishies and person 2 has one as well they can have the same type of squishies but not always

class Desk {
    public string Name;
    public int Height;
    public List<Squishi> DeskSquishies;

    public Desk(sting theName) {
        Name = theName;
        Height = 1;
        DeskSquishies = new List<Squishi>();
    }
    public void AddSquishi() {

    }
}
