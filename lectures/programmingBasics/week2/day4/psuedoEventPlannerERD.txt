Create an ERD to represent the database for an application that allows users to plan events and rsvp to others' events.

Each event should have a title, a description, location, a start time, and an end time. Each user should have a name and an address. Use the MySQL Workbench for creating this diagram.

Tables needed = user, event, rsvp

user table needs = name, address
event table  needs = title, description, location, starttime, endtime, creator(user_id)
rsvp tables needs = event(event_id), attendee(user_id)


create an ERD for a class signup

each class should have the title, teacher, location, description, start and stop
each user should have a first and last name

1 user can create the class
many users can sign up for the class

tables = users, classes, signups

users table = first and last name
class table = title teacher location, desc, start and stop, user_id
signup table = class_id user_id



users = Teachers and Students
events = the event and who created it (the clipboard)
rsvp = who added thier names to the event clipboard


as a user i can created an event because someone has to make the clipboard and hang it up for other users to someone
as a user i can also attend events as I am always learning myself and someone else might be teaching something I want to know - this is why the users is both teachers and students combined


Dasbhboard

tables = user, message


user table = username, password, first, last, level=0, createdat, description
message table = content, messageLeaver(user_id), createdat, messageReciever(user_id)
