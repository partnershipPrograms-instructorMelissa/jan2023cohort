# OOP

Methods Vs Attributes:
Attributes is how we describe objects
Methods is how we use objects

Object Oriented Programming
1. Abstraction -complex action in simple verbs -- when you only show the necessary details to the user. They dont need to know the inner mechanisms of what is going on. we only expose the necessary details and hiding the irrelevant information. like when we use .toLowerCase 
2. Inheritance - can pass from the parent class to the child class attributes and methods - mom and child - child inherits some attribute and methods but also is own person
3. Polymorphism - same method on different method on different objects - same action but in different ways
4. Encapsulation - binding data and methods together that belong logically together, to kinda help keep responsibility where it belongs - data and behaviors is contained inside the class / Private VS Global
