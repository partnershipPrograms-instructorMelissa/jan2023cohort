        <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
        <p>Javascript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. Javascript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. Javascript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <span id="blue">Variable Declaration</span> Javascript variables are containers for storing data values- imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. <span id="purple">var x;</span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="blue">Variable Assignment</span> Assignment operators assign values to Javascript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span id="purple">var x = 10</span>;
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id="blue">Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are Javascript primitives: Boolean- <span id="purple">true</span> or <span id = "purple">false;</span> null- <span id="purple"> null</span> aka nothing; Number- <span id="purple"> 42 </span> or <span id="purple"> 3.14159; </span> String- <span id="purple"> "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; </span> Array- <span id="purple"> [1, 'Coding', 2, 'Dojo']; </span> and Object- <span id="purple">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name:'Doe'} </span>
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id = "blue">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions- hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span id="purple"> if </span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span id="purple"> else if </span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span id="purple"> else </span> we execute this block of code;
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id = "blue">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!
            </li>
            <li>
                <span id = "blue">Function</span> Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over again.
